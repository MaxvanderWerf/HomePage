# Welcome To My Datascience Portfolio!

My name is Max van der Werf, I'm an aspiring datascientist currently doing Msc. Applied Data Science at Utrecht University in the Netherlands.
On this page I will be sharing what I have done in the past, what I'm currently working on and what I'm planning to do in the future. 

## Projects

### Project 1 - [Script to Automatically Download and Set Desktop Wallpaper](https://github.com/MaxvanderWerf/Unsplash_IMG_Downloader) 
* Written a script that automatically downloads and sets a new desktop wallpaper for me everyday
* Using Selenium, the script opens Unsplash.com and searches for wallpapers by randomly selecting a searchterm from a list to add some variety
* The script then downloads the wallpapers from Unsplash.com 
* Finally, the script automatically sets the desktop background 
* Using a batch file and Windows Task Manager, this script is executed daily to provide me with a fresh new background everyday
