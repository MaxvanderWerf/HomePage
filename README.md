# Welcome to my Github webpage!

My name is Max van der Werf, I'm an aspiring datascientist currently doing Msc. Applied Data Science at Utrecht University in the Netherlands.
On this page I will be sharing what I've been working on and what I have done in the past. 

## Projects

### Project 1 - Script to Automatically Download and Set Desktop Wallpaper 
* Written a script that downloads and sets a new desktop wallpaper for me everyday.
* The script first downloads one of the wallpapers from Unsplash.com 
* Then the script automatically sets the desktop background using a batch file and Windows Task Manager.
