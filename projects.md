# Projects
A list of the projects I have worked on so far

### My Own Projects:

#### Project 1 - [Script to Automatically Download and Set Desktop Wallpaper](https://github.com/MaxvanderWerf/Unsplash_IMG_Downloader) 
* Written a script that automatically downloads and sets a new desktop wallpaper for me everyday
* Using Selenium, the script opens Unsplash.com and searches for wallpapers by randomly selecting a searchterm from a list to add some variety
* The script then downloads the images using the selected searchterm (such as 'Nature' or 'Utrecht') 
* Finally, the script sets one of the downloaded images as my desktop background 
* Using a batch file and Windows Task Manager, this script is automatically executed daily
